This is their response:
 
60% are proactive automated-raised incidents following P3M-FAB Integration Failures (These incidents are not categorised as customer incidents within the volumes provided)." - Response - These tickets are because of Boomi migration; in a years' time it will get stable. For the 1st year SW have asked to assume some effort to resolve the issues. (we can assume 25% of effort are need) • Workday: Not used for payroll, only for HR.
 
Estimated Ticket Volume (15–20/month)
Question was: Is this correct or will there be more tickets under projects/proactive work?

 
They did not directly confirm the DevOps number. The only related number they gave was the Boomi migration proactive incidents (60% automated)  but that is integration related, not DevOps specific.
 
not all will be answered precisely Rajat, make an assumption and update the estimation
 
park your assumption in the respective tab of the RLS sheet
 
Bhim Sharma: The assumption will be 20-30
 
we already have factored one L3 for the Devops... should be fine to resolve the issues pertaining to integration ones
 
Yes. Bhim Sharma Since we already have one L3 devops resource planned, we will be able to handle the integration issues from Boomi migratio as well.
 
no change in efforts there
 
One more point to note here is: They are saying "Enterprise Monitoring Tool: Scottish Water does not have an enterprise monitoring tool. Application monitoring is not currently done. They tried investing in some tools but did not get a ROI. • ServiceNow: Expected to play a key role in monitoring applications."
 
Finops support is only for working hours.. one resource already factored... 
 
it is only ticketing tool
 
we need to enable proactive monitoring for the same
 
we factored 5 assocaites.   
 
Let me check if they have mentioned any other tool, but in the latest mail, they have written no enterprise monitoring tool.
 
check the overall components that needs to be montored.
 
accordingly check what azure team hs provisioned for the same
 
azure team already looks after monitoring, governance, and cost management for platform. they use azure monitor for alerts and dashboards, azure policy and role based access control for governance, key vault for storing secrets, and entra id for identity management. 
 
they also use scottish water’s financial operations tools for cost optimisation and finding unusual spending.
 
 resources are created using bicep infrastructure as code, and azure devops is used for building and releasing changes. 
 
the lot 2 partner will work within these existing tools instead of bringing new ones.//this
 
Bhim Sharma 
 
Table 44 mai mentioned h -->  Digital Platforms Team responsibilities
 
so for Snow ...we have factored for 24X7 support... will that be required
 
they are expecting incident and request management on 24x7 basis
 
means?
 
Document me likha hai ki serviceNow unka main tool h incident, request, change aur monitoring ke liye.
digital experience centre ke liye unhone 24x7 ka option rakha h aur incidents 24x7 handle karne h
Isliye snow ka  24x7.
 
ok, then our factoring is correct
 
Yes
